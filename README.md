# SpaceY

## Overview
Project description: </br>
In this capstone, you will take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket
company.
Your job is to determine the price of each launch.
You will do this by gathering information about Space X.
You will also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully,
you will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX
will reuse the first stage. 

## Development process
1. Collect data
* With SpaceX API
* With Web Scrapping Wikipedia
2. Data Wrangling
3. Exploratory Analysis 
* Using SQL
* Using pandas and matplotlib
4. Creating maps with Folium
5. Searching for best model
